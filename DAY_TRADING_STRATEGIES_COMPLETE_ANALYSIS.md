## 🔧 **Strategy Optimization Recommendations**

### **1. Market Condition Filtering**
```python
# Add to any strategy
dataframe['bull_market'] = dataframe['close'] > dataframe['sma_200']
dataframe['bear_market'] = dataframe['close'] < dataframe['sma_200']

# Only trade in bear markets
dataframe.loc[
    (dataframe['bear_market'] == True) &
    (other_conditions),
    'enter_long'] = 1
```

### **2. Improved ROI Structure**
```python
# For 5-minute timeframe
minimal_roi = {
    "0": 0.02,    # 2% profit target
    "30": 0.015,  # 1.5% after 30 minutes
    "60": 0.01,   # 1% after 1 hour
    "120": 0.005, # 0.5% after 2 hours
}
```

### **3. Better Exit Logic**
```python
# Add trend reversal exits
dataframe['trend_reversal'] = (
    (dataframe['sma_fast'] < dataframe['sma_slow']) &
    (dataframe['sma_fast'].shift(1) > dataframe['sma_slow'].shift(1))
)

dataframe.loc[dataframe['trend_reversal'], 'exit_long'] = 1
```
