---

## üéØ **Bottom Line**

**PatternRecognition is the best strategy overall**, but **all strategies significantly underperform simple buy & hold** in most market conditions. The data clearly shows that:

1. **Timing the market is extremely difficult**
2. **Trading costs eat into returns**
3. **Simple buy & hold often beats complex strategies**
4. **Overly complex strategies (like GodStra) can be completely ineffective**
5. **Risk management is more important than strategy selection**

**The best approach for most investors remains: Buy Bitcoin, hold it, and don't try to time the market.**

### **Key Takeaway:**
**GodStra's complete failure (0 trades) demonstrates that overly complex strategies with too many conditions can be completely ineffective, making them worse than even the worst-performing simple strategies.**

**Bandtastic's massive losses (-35% to -36%) demonstrate that high-frequency trading with poor win rates can be extremely destructive to capital, especially when combined with high trading costs.**
